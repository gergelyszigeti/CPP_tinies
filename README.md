Some interesting stuff I wrote in C++.
Detailed explanation is on the way, check back later.

On Linux, MacOS terminal, Cygwin, simply type `make`.
Then each tiny program can be run by typing `./<program_name>`
To avoid flooding your screen, you can also type `./<program_name> > output.txt`,
then check the contents of `output.txt` with your favorite text editor.
Many of them can be used with an argument: `./<program name> <argument>`
Type `make clean` when you are already tired of running them.
